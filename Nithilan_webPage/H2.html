Kev's mum eyed us both. "Okay ,but no fooling around she muttered as she turned up the TV. It was Neighbours and for the next half-an-hour total silece would be demanded. Lugging my dad's tent between us, Kev and I sneaked out of the backdoor. At long last, we had permission to spend the night camping out, even if it was only at the bottom of Kevâ€™s garden.</p>

Kev turned on his torch and we stared out across the garden at the house. Each room was lit up with the lights glowing like yellow pumpkins. However, down at the end of the garden where we were, it was getting darker and darker as if we were sinking into a deep pit. Stars came out like tiny silver studs. The moon cast an eerie, silver light over the garden and it grew colder.</p>
